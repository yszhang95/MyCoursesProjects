\begin{abstract}
Gravitational lensing effect was proposed in 1936 and finally observed in 1979. Besides the test of general relativity, it has become one of the most powerful techniques in astronomy, to probe dark matter and the geometry of the universe. In this paper, I will discuss the theoretical basics of the lensing effect and experimental results. These include the observation of the twin quasars, the application of gravitational lensing in determination of distributions of dark matter, and the measurements of Hubble constant.

* Introduction
  <<sec:intro>>
  The general relativity is a theory of gravitation, established by
  Einstein in 1915. It is a generalization of the special relativity,
  in which theory the speed of light remains the same in all inertial
  frames and the physical laws are expressed in covariant forms,
  independent on the frames. In addition to the postulates above, two
  additional principles are proposed in the general relativity. The
  first one is that the inertial mass shows equivalence to the
  gravitational mass. The effects from gravity can be effectively
  eliminated in a small local region of space and time. In this sense,
  physical laws seem the same as they are in flat space-time described
  by Minkowskian space. The second principle is that the space-time is
  curved rather than flat. The curvature is determined the gravity via
  Einstein field equations.

  Over the past century, the general relativity shows success through
  the consistency with a lot of experiments. The perihelion precession
  of planets are well described by Einstein's theory
  citep:RevModPhys.19.361.  The precession of 42.88'' of Mercury's
  orbit strongly supports the theory, for instance. The observation of
  redshifts also shows the evidence of effects from the general
  relativity. cite:PhysRevLett.4.337 detected the energy loss of
  \gamma ray at the receiver higher than the emitter, making use of
  M\"{o}ssbauer effect. Recent observation of the gravitational
  radiation shows great success of the theory of relativity as
  well. LIGO collaboration announced the detection of the
  gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger
  citep:Abbott:2016blz.

  Besides the phenomena mentioned above, an intriguing effects is the
  deflection of light by a massive object. The light ray travels
  along the geodesic which is not "straight" line anymore as a result
  of curved space-time. This effect induce an interesting phenomena
  called gravitational lensing, which was first proposed by
  cite:Einstein506. If a massive object is placed between the source
  and the observer, the light rays will be deflected and thus the
  observer may find magnified images of the source. This phenomena was
  confirmed by the discovery of quasar QSO 0957+561A,B
  cite:Walsh:1979nx.

  This paper will discuss the theoretical basics and experimental
  results briefly. It is organized in the following way: simple models
  of gravitational lensing will be introduced in Sec. [[sec:theo]]; the
  results in experiment will be discussed in Sec. [[sec:expr]]; and
  summary and outlook will be outlined in Sec. [[sec:summ]].

* Theoretical basics
  <<sec:theo>>

  In this section, a few simple models of gravitational lensing will
  be discussed. Two categories will be introduced: lensing by the
  point mass and lensing by the galaxy. Here we follow the
  derivations in cite:narayanlectures1997.

  In general, the mathematical formulism is hard to resolve and quite
  complicated for the light propagation in an arbitrary curved
  space. We limit ourselves in this paper by the weak gravitational
  field and non-relativistic condition. Therefore the spacetime can be
  described by a locally flat Minkowskian spacetime with perturbations
  from the lensing object with Newtonian gravitational potential. The
  motion of the mass object inducing lensing effect is also very slow.
  These conditions are satisfied in most times. See discussions in
  cite:narayanlectures1997.

  <<sec:theo-point-mass>> The light ray from distant source will be
  deflected by an angle
\begin{equation}
  \vec{\hat{\alpha}} = \frac{4GM}{c^{2}b} \label{eq:alpha-hat}
\end{equation}
where M is the mass of lensing
  object and b is the impact parameter. The case considered here is
  limited that the both sources and observers are far away from the
  lensing. Thus the deflection happens in a very small region,
  characterized by the impact parameter. And the distribution along
  line of sight becomes unimportant. The intervening object can be
  treated as a thin sheet orthogonal to the line of sight. This plane
  of the mass sheet is usually referred to lens plane. The projected
  mass distribution, or surface mass distribution, is expressed by

  \begin{equation}
\Sigma(\vec{\xi}) = \int \rho(\vec{\xi}, z)dz \label{eq:mass-sheet}
  \end{equation}
  where $\vec{\xi}$ is the two-dimensional vector in the
  lens plane. Combining eqref:eq:alpha-hat and eqref:eq:mass-sheet
  will give the overall deflection by the thin mass sheet,
\begin{equation}
\vec{\hat{\alpha}} = \frac{4G}{c^2} \int \frac{(\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi'})\Sigma(\vec{\xi'})}{|\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi'}|^2} d^2 \xi'
\label{eq:alpha-mass-sum}
\end{equation}
  For a circularly symmetric lens, as a special case, the problem is
  reduced to one-dimension. The deflection angle is a function of the
  distance to the center of the mass sheet in lens plane. The
  expression is simplified as
\begin{equation}
\hat{\alpha} = \frac{4GM(\xi)}{c^2\xi}
\label{eq:alpha-mass-1D}
\end{equation}
  where \xi is the distance from the lens center and M(\xi) is the
  mass enclosed within the radius \xi, given by
\begin{equation}
M(\xi) = 2\pi \int^{\xi}_0 \Sigma(\xi')\xi'd\xi'.
\label{eq:m-1D}
\end{equation}

#+NAME: fig:one_image
[[./figures/one_image.png]]

  As mentioned above, in the approximation of locally flat Minkowskian
  spacetime with perturbations of gravitation, the relation
\begin{equation}
separation = distance \times angle \label{eq:distance}
\end{equation}
  holds.  Denoting the distance between the observer and the source,
  the observer and the lens, and the lens and the source with D_s, D_d
  and D_ds, respectively, we will have $\theta D_s = \beta D_s -
  \hat{\alpha}D_{ds}$. This relation is obvious as illustrated in
  Fig. [[fig:one_image]].  Introducing reduced deflection angle
  \begin{equation}
\vec{\alpha} = \frac{D_{ds}}{D_s} \vec{\hat{\alpha}},
\label{eq:alpha-reduce}
  \end{equation}
  lens equation is finally obtained
  \begin{equation}
\vec{\beta} = \vec{\theta} - \vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta}). \label{eq:len}
  \end{equation}
  Note that Equation eqref:eq:distance is not neccessary to be true in
  curved space. However, Equations eqref:eq:alpha-reduce and
  eqref:eq:len are true if the distance is /defined/ to satisfy the
  Equation eqref:eq:distance.

  Taking constant surface-mass density as an example, the reduced deflection angle is
  \begin{equation}
\alpha(\theta) = \frac{4\pi G\Sigma}{c^2}\frac{D_d D_{ds}}{D_s} \theta, \label{eq:alpha-reduce-circular}
  \end{equation}
  setting $\xi = D_d \theta$. For a lens lies on the optical axis
  (\beta=0), the corresponding constant surface mass density is
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{cr} = \frac{c^2}{4\pi G} \frac{D_s}{D_d D_{ds}}. \label{eq:sigma-critical}
\end{equation}
  The light rays from the sources perfectly focus on the position of
  observer, though the focus length depends on both the lensing object
  and the positions of the source and the observer. In this case, the
  mass density is referred as /critical/ surface mass density. In case
  of \Sigma > \Sigma_{cr}, multiple images will show up and the
  corresponding surface mass density is referred as /supercritical/.

  Considering the case of the circularly symmetric lens, but with an
  arbitraty mass distribution, according to Equations eqref:eq:alpha-hat
  and eqref:eq:alpha-reduce, the lens equation becomes
\begin{equation}
\beta(\theta) = \theta - \frac{D_{ds}}{D_d D_s} \frac{4GM(\theta)}{c^2\theta} \label{eq:len-circular}.
\end{equation}
  For a source lying on the optic axis (\beta=0) the solution for the images reads
   \begin{equation}
\theta_E = \bigg[ \frac{4GM(\theta_E)}{c^2} \frac{D_{ds}}{D_d D_s}\bigg]^{1/2}
   \end{equation}
  From the rotational symmetry, we know that the images are located
  at the ring of \theta_E. The ring is called Einstein ring and the
  \theta_E is called Einstein radius.

  An instructive example is the case of lensing by point mass, the Einstein radius is given by
   \begin{equation}
\theta_E = \bigg[ \frac{4GM}{c^2} \frac{D_{ds}}{D_d D_s}\bigg]^{1/2}
   \end{equation}
   and the lens equation reads
   \begin{equation}
\beta = \theta - \frac{\theta_E^2}{\theta}.
   \end{equation}
  The images are
\begin{equation}
\theta_{\pm} = \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \beta\pm\sqrt{\beta^2+4\theta_E^2} \bigg).
\end{equation}
  Thus one is inside the Einstein ring and the other is outside.

  Though the phenomena is intersting, the magnification of point
  mass lens is hard to observe unless the lens is extremely
  massive. However, the detection become reliable if the lens and the
  source move relative to each other. The relative motion will enlarge
  the lensing-induced time delay and the effect is referred as
  microlensing if the lensing object has stellar mass. And it has been
  observed in QSO 2237+0305 citep:1990ApJ_358L_33W.

  <<sec:theo-galaxies>> The point mass model has been discussed so
  far. It turns out complicated and dependent on the model of mass
  distribution when considering galaxies as lens. Here we consider a
  simple model.

  We assume the constituents in the galaxies behave like particles of
  ideal gas. Their gravitational potential is spherical symmetric and
  confining them inside the galaxy. The equation of state of these
  mass constituents reads
   \begin{equation}
p = \frac{\rho kT}{m} \label{eq:thermal-energy}
   \end{equation}
  where \rho is the mass density of the galaxy and the m is the mass
  of the constituent. In thermal equilibrium, we have
   \begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} m \sigma_{v}^2 = \frac{1}{2} kT
   \end{equation}
  where \sigma_v is the one-dimensional velocity dispersion. Assuming
  the galaxy is isothermal, the dispersion is constant over the
  region of the galaxy. The hydrostatic equation
  $\frac{\nabla p}{\rho}=\vec{f}$ reads
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{dp}{dr} = -\frac{GM(r)}{r^2} \label{eq:hydrostatic}
\end{equation}
  since \rho, p and M are merely functions of r and $\frac{dM}{dr} =
  4\pi r^2 \rho$ due to the rotational symmetry. Combing Equations
  eqref:eq:thermal-energy and eqref:eq:hydrostatic, the solution reads
\begin{equation}
\rho(r) = \frac{\sigma_v^2}{2\pi G}\frac{1}{r^2}.
\end{equation}

  This mass distribution is referred as the /singular isothermal
  sphere/. The density is proportional to r^{-2}. There are also other
  models for the mass distribution of galaxies but we will not discuss
  them here.

  It is also useful to define the the projected Newtonian potential of
  the lens. It is related to the magnification of the lens. The projected
  potential is defined as
\begin{equation}
\psi(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{D_{ds}}{D_d D_s} \frac{2}{c^2} \int \Phi(D_d \vec{\theta}, z)dz
\end{equation}
  where \Phi is the Newtonian in three-dimension. The gradient of \psi
  with respect to \theta is simply $\vec{\alpha}$,
\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\theta} \psi = \vec{\alpha}.
\end{equation}
  And we know the divergence of the gravitational potential is
  proportional to the mass density. Thus we have
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2_{\theta} \psi = \frac{2}{c^2} \frac{D_d D_{ds}}{D_s} \int \nabla^2_\xi \Phi dz = \frac{2}{c^2}\frac{D_d D_{ds}}{D_s} 4\pi G\Sigma = 2\frac{\Sigma(\vec{\theta})}{\Sigma_{cr}}\equiv 2\kappa(\vec{\theta}).
\end{equation}
  The term \kappa is called convergence.

  The magnification of the lens is defined as
\begin{equation}
magnification = \frac{image\,\, area}{source\,\, area} = \mathrm{det}( \frac{\delta \theta^2} {{\delta \beta^2}} ).
\end{equation}
  Thus the Jacobian matrix $A\equiv\partial\vec{\beta}/\partial\vec{\theta}$
  is the inverse of the magnification tensor. We have
\begin{equation}
A = \bigg(\delta_{ij} - \partial{\alpha_i}/\partial \beta_j\bigg) = \bigg( \delta_{ij} - \frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial\theta_i\theta_j} \bigg).
\end{equation}
It can be further written as
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
A &=
\begin{pmatrix}
1-\kappa-\gamma_1 & -\gamma_2 \\
-\gamma_2 & 1+\kappa+\gamma_1
\end{pmatrix}
\\
&=(1-\kappa)
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0\\0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
-\gamma
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos{2\phi} & \sin{2\phi} \\
\sin{2\phi} & -\cos{2\phi}
\end{pmatrix},
\end{split}
\end{align}
  by introducing notations
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial\theta_i\theta_j} &\equiv \psi_{ij} \\
\kappa &= \frac{1}{2}(\psi_{11}+\psi_{22}) \\
\gamma_1 &= \frac{1}{2}(\psi_{11}-\psi_{22})\equiv \gamma \cos{2\phi} \\
\gamma_2 &= \psi_{12} = \psi_{21} \equiv \gamma \sin{2\phi}.
\end{align}
Term \kappa is named convergence and \gamma_j is named shear
tensor. The quantity \gamma denotes the magnitude of the shear and
\phi denotes the orientation. The magnification is
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{det}A^{-1} = \frac{1}{(1-\kappa)^2-\gamma^2}.
\end{equation}

* Experimental results

  [[./figures/twin.jpg]]

  <<sec:expr>> As mentioned in Sec. [[sec:intro]], the discovery of
  QSO957+561A,B shows strong evidence of the existence of
  gravitational lensing effect citep:Walsh:1979nx. Fig. [[fig:twin]]
  shows the image of the quasar QSO957+561 by Hubble Space Telescope.
  The results are briefly discussed here. QSO957+561A,B are images of
  a single quasar. A quasar is also known as a quasi-stellar object
  (QSO), discovered by cite:schmidt3c1963. It is the nuclear region
  with extremely high luminosity of a remote galaxy. As a result of
  large distance, the probability of observing lensing effects of
  massive objects between quasars and observers become large. Quasars
  provide opportunities to discover gravitational lensing in
  experiments. The explanation of lensing effects for two images,
  QSO957+561A,B, separated by 6'', was finally confirmed by
  cite:1980ApJ241507Y,1984ApJ287538G. Fig. [[fig:spectra-QSO0957-561]]
  show the spectra of wavelength of QSO957+561A,B and they show
  similarity with each other. The evidence is provided by the facts
  below:
  - The similarity of flux spectra between two images.
  - The intervening galaxy between images and the observers
  - The luminous distribution of cores of two images are related by a
    magnification matrix according to lensing effects.

  In addition to the test of gravitation theory, the lensing effects
  can also help in several ways in the astronomical measurements. It
  was proposed that the Hubble constant could be measured through the
  gravitational lensing citep:1964MNRAS128307R. The time of light
  propagation of two images are uneven since the effective length of
  path are different. The time delay difference \Delta\tau between two
  images is proportional to the difference of path of length and thus
  the inverse of Hubble constant (H_0^{-1}). The product
  $H_0\Delta\tau$ depends merely on the geometric positions of
  sources, lensing and observers and the model of lensing
  effects. Once $H_0\Delta\tau$ is determined and \Delta\tau is
  measured, the Hubble constant is also obtained.

  The way using gravitational lensing to determine Hubble constant has
  several advantages citep:narayanlectures1997:
  - The sources are distant at large redshifts and their velocities
    can be considered small enough compared to the Hubble flow.
  - The measurements does not wait for the motion of sources with the
    expansion of the universe. There is no need to measure the
    increasing distance and time interval. The time delay of images
    can be measured in a short time.
  - The gravitational lensing originates the general relativity, which
    is well tested in a series of experiments. It is less
    model-dependent or less empirical.

  To precisely measure the Hubble constant, several difficulties need
  to be overcome. These include: the precision measurements of the
  differences between arrival times of multiple images; the
  understanding of the distortion of the angular diameter distances
  along the line of sight; the model for the mass distribution of the
  lens citep:Birrer2020. The procedures of time delay measurements has
  been validated via simulations citep:2015ApJ_799_168D. The
  distortion of line of sight is corrected statistically via
  comparisons with numerical simulations citep:2011MNRAS_410_2167F and
  the residual is negligible compared to overall uncertainties
  citep:Millon_2020. The third issue is still under investigation. One
  recent measurement implementing gravitational lensing infers that
  the the value of Hubble constant is $73.3^{+1.7}_{1.8}$ km s^{-1}
  Mpc^{-1}, in agreement with local measurements type Ia supernovae
  citep:Wong2019. Fig. [[fig:H0wong]] shows the probability density
  distribution of H_0.

  #+CAPTION: The posterior probability density distributions for H_0 from different individual lensing systems. Six systems are denoted by shaded area and the black curve is the combined result of H_0 citep:Wong2019.
  #+NAME: fig:H0wong
  [[./figures/H0WongEtAl.png]]

  Besides the implication for Hubble constant, gravitational lensing
  also serve as powerful tools to probe the lensing objects
  themselves. Thus it provide good probes to searching for dark matter
  and dark energy. And it merely depends on the mass distributions of
  dark matters, regardless the their intrinsic nature.

  However, several issues presents in the processes of exploration of
  dark matters. Signals from large-scale structure is very faint with
  little chance to detect. And mass distributions of measurable
  galaxies are need to be fixed as priori. The atmosphere of the Earth
  also smears the signal. To overcome these difficulties, Hubble Space
  Telescope was launched. It produced the projected 2D map of dark
  matters for the fist time citep:Massey2007. Fig. [[fig:dark-matter]]
  shows the comparison between the distributions of dark matters and
  ordinary matters. The similarity between maps of dark matters and
  maps of baryonic matters indicates that dark matters are still under
  the rule of gravitation citep:Ellis2010darkmatter.

  #+NAME: fig:dark-matter
  [[./figures/dark_matter.png]]

  In addition to the studies of dark matters in cluster, the search
  for dark matters in a galaxy is also of interests. The gravitational
  effects assist to detect the haloes of a galaxy. Measurements are
  performed via galaxy-galaxy lensing, selecting a subset of
  classified images. Combing these images will give the average
  density of dark matter of a given galaxy.

* Summary and outlook
  <<sec:summ>> The theoretical basics and experimental outputs have
  been presented in this paper. The gravitational lensing as a
  manifestation of Einstein's theory have been observed in many
  experiments. In addition to serving merely tests for the theory of
  gravitation, the lensing effects have advantages for astronomical
  observations. It helps in several aspects: detecting the distant
  objects which is invisible without lensing effects; probing the mass
  distribution of the lensing objects, for instance, dark matters;
  determining the overall properties of the universe. These
  measurements have enriched the knowledge for the universe and
  provide valuable experiences to explore further.

  [[./figures/H0discrepancy.png]]

  The recent measurements of Hubble constant shows discrepancy between
  the early universe value from cosmic micro waves and late universe
  value from gravitational lensing with a tension of $5.3\sigma$
  citep:Wong2019. This raise a question whether there is new physics
  behind the puzzle. Before proposing new physics theories, further
  constraints on the cosmography of time delay are needed at
  first. The precision of H_0 values by gravitational lensing can be
  further improved.

  There are also discrepancies between the standard cold dark mater
  (CDM) paradigm and observations. cite:Meneghetti_2020 reported an
  excess of more than an order of magnitude of gravitational lensing
  than the predictions from CDM simulations. Either the unresolved
  systematic issues with simulations or the correction to CDM model
  are needed to explain the results.

  In summary, gravitational lensing manifest itself the evidence of
  general relativity. It is also valuable probe to explore the
  universe. More interesting physics phenomena can be explored in the
  future, using the lensing technique.
