                  Gravitational Lensing. We discuss lensing by point

                  and larger-scale structures in the Universe. The
                  relevant theory is developed and applications to
                  astrophysical problems are discussed.},

The effect is caused by the gravitational deflection of light from a star S in the gravitational field of another star By and occurs when S lies far behind B , but close to the line of sight through B . It turns out that a considerable increase in the apparent luminosity of S is possible. A method is given to determine the mass of a star which acts as a gravitational lens. The possibility of observing the effect is discussed. }",

In 1963, Maarten Schmidt solved the puzzle by recognizing the Balmer lines of hydrogen, strongly redshifted, in the spectrum of the quasar 3C 273. Schmidt reached the "most direct and least objectionable" conclusion, that 3C 273 was no star, but the enormously bright nucleus of a distant galaxy.},
