                  Gravitational Lensing. We discuss lensing by point

                  and larger-scale structures in the Universe. The

                  astrophysical problems are discussed.},

The effect is caused by the gravitational deflection of light from a star S in the gravitational field of another star By and occurs when S lies far behind B , but close to the line of sight through B . It turns out that a considerable increase in the apparent luminosity of S is possible. A method is given to determine the mass of a star which acts as a gravitational lens. The possibility of observing the effect is discussed. }",

    abstract = { I review the development of gravitational lensing as a powerful tool of the observational cosmologist. After the historic eclipse expedition organized by Arthur Eddington and Frank Dyson, the subject lay observationally dormant for 60 years. However, subsequent progress has been astonishingly rapid, especially in the past decade, so that gravitational lensing now holds the key to unravelling the two most profound mysteries of our Universe—the nature and distribution of dark matter, and the origin of the puzzling cosmic acceleration first identified in the late 1990s. In this non-specialist review, I focus on the unusual history and achievements of gravitational lensing and its future observational prospects. }
